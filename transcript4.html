            Hello listeners

You are listening to the podcast the describers diary.
<br>
<br>
This is our 4th episode and today's episode is regarding the psychology behind attraction and the love . personally it was one of most exciting topic while gathering information going through psychologist's theories and explanations in different references.
There are few things everyone has to go through them one or the other day in their life and one such thing is Love .it's such an ambiguous and cryptic subject that even if the whole world runs due on love people are trying to understand it from hundreds of centuries.
It's like an ocean but let as dive as deep as we can.
<br>
<br>
Love and attraction both of these topics are inter wind so closely yet they are not the same.The is a hairline difference between them
Attraction is that door which leads to a House Full of Love waiting for you.
<br>
<br>
Love entails attraction but attraction can exist without love for example. You came across the person in your workplace or in your university ,you actually don't know anything about that person or even you don't bother to know but still find that person attractive . Starting step towards love is attraction ,But love ,takes time it needs nurturing.
There is something called imprinting . The idea of imprinting was discovered by the English biologist Douglas splanding imprinting is a phase sensitive learning that occurs during a certain age of your life. Imprinting and attraction are interlinked .Attraction is not only unconscious but also largely physical .this one question that's makes you blush while answering it that's what kind of person do you like. 
<br>
<br>
I think many of your friends and family members might have asked it right . every one have some preferences and an Idea on what type of person you like . some people also answer it in this way .I still haven't figured it out .but they don't know that subconsciously there is something called imprinting going inside your brain that actually is the rationale behind your preferences or qualities you find attractive in a person. Imprinting is of a various types like filial imprinting , limbic imprinting , the one that's related with attraction is sexual imprinting. Actually what is means is there are some qualities that are recorded in a part of your brain based on what kind of person you are and the environment you are exposed too.
<br>
<br>
In your daily life ,your brain actually imprints qualities which you subconsciously .There are multiple reasons like physical behavioral and emotional reasons .when you come across a person with majority of the the preferences that got imprinted your brain you might experience this magnetic feel called attraction towards him or her. let's go through few examples so that it will help you to relate it with your life .There is a boy who is adopted by a women and when he is grown up with all the love and emotions by his adoptive mother. His brain imprints all those caring good qualities of his mother so he might find a girl attrcative with that type of caring behaviour these are the reasons why you get attracted especially to some people and the basis of your preferences
<br>
<br>
From this you can also observe that there is a pattern or a common thing you find attractive it can be behaviour like sense of humour or it can be physical like big eyes .while selecting a person or a relationship attraction maybe a guide but that can't be the foundation for love and working of that relation doesn't depend on attraction. attraction or infatuation is an intense short lived passion for someone . love is beyond all that attracts you. There are chances of this attraction gets converted into love but those are not 100% we can't estimate how long this attraction is going to last . it depends upon situations and people .this imprinting is not only seen in humans but also in birds , there are some of experiments done on birds which prove
that ,there is a psychological reason to elucidate the magic behind the attraction to good extent.

<br>
Speaking about the next section of our episode love this small four letter words the its many disciplines like biology philosophy and psychology to analyse and understand it.
It's just takes fraction of seconds to fall in love , that moment when to find some one who makes you heart pound , eyes dilate and stare and them. This feeling is not exaggerated or just limited to movies , it's true and you will believe it when you will experience it .
When you meet some one who you can't take your eyes off , your body and brain is going to produce cocktail of neurotransmitters and hormones.
<br>
<br>
Let's start with adrenaline and endorphins this a rush of adrenaline is going to increase your heartbeat causes sweaty plams and dilates pupils . Endorphins are peptides produced by pituitary gland and hypothalamus parts of brain these are feel good chemicals which cause the feeling of euphoria and feel . These both with the rest are
going to give that feel called falling in love when you see a person. It might be a mere biological response of body that's called as love at first sight it is still not yet decided completely.being in a relationship like getting attached or addicted to that person , that feel where you miss them or want to spend more and more time with them are related some complex areas in you brain called reward centre .

<br>
<br>
When the person's actions or behaviour make you happy that leads to release of feel good neurotransmitter called dopamine that activates the reward centre that makes you happy . So you starting liking his or her company and just want to spend more time .
If the relation goes well , this realse of dopamine activating you reward centre continue since you spend more and more time with that person and you slowly get addicted to that person .
Dr Nasser zawia who explores the concept of love and biology said that in the beginning biology is most important but as the love matures psychology plays the lead role .
<br>
<br>
We have already covered the biological part so let's know about the psycological part behind this beautiful emotion .
Abraham Maslow is father of huministic psychologist proposed humanistic theory that focuses on human potential and says that we can choose the life patterns that support our personal growth
There is no psychology class thats complete without describing Maslow heirarcy of needs .
<br>
<br>
Maslow heirarcy is a pyramid with most fundamental needs at the bottom and human distinct needs at top .starting from the bottom to the top first comes the physiological needs followed by safety needs ,love belonging needs
