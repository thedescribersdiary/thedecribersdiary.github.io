        Hello listeners
You are listening to the podcast ‘the describers dairy’

This is our 5th episode regarding the concept of ‘forgetting’
In our life time we forget many things and memories, we all are curious to know about how we forget and how we can remember some things after sometimes without our consciousness Here we are to share few interesting things about this topic.
Firstly before going to this concept what does memory mean in biologically terms ?
<br>
<br>
Memories make us who we are ,memories are stored as chemical changes at the connection points known as synapses present between the neurons in the brain .
Now coming to our main concept forgetting
Forgetting or disremembering is the apparent loss or modification of information already encoded and stored in an individual's short or long-term memory. It is a spontaneous or gradual process in which old memories are unable to be recalled from memory storage.
<br>
<br>
There are 3 theories regarding the forgetting
<br>
1.	The trace decay theory ; According to this theory, forgetting occurs because of the fading of the memory traces or engrams as a result of the lack of using the stored item for a long period.
<br>
2.	The theory of inhibition or interference; According to this theory, forgetting occurs because of
the interference or inhibition of the memory traces of stored or learned items. There are two kinds of interference:
<br>
a.	Proactive inhibition: if the earlier learnig interferes with later learning and inhibits recall of new material it is known as proactive inhibition
<br>
b.	retroactive inhibition ; inhibition of the earlier learning and recall by later learning is known as
retroactive inhibition .
<br>
3.	the repression theory ; it is a defensive mechanism that painfull items are thrown into unconscious mind and the person does not with to remember them .
<br>
<br>
Memories are cannot be erased easily from our brain like as it is done in a system with simply
delete option . this deletion of memory takes place through some chemical changes that tooks place in our brain’.
when a new memory is first formed, there also exists an active, dopamine-based forgetting
mechanism -- ongoing dopamine neuron activity -- that begins to erase those memories unless some importance is attached to them, a process known as consolidation that may shield important memories from the dopamine-driven forgetting process.
<br>
<br>
The study shows that specific neurons in the brain release dopamine to two different receptors
known as dDA1 and DAMB, located on what are called mushroom bodies because of their shape; these densely packed networks of neurons are vital for memory and learning in insects. The study found the dDA1 receptor is responsible for memory acquisition, while DAMB is required for forgetting.
<br>
<br>
When dopamine neurons begin the signaling process, the dDA1 receptor becomes overstimulated
and begins to form memories, an essential part of memory acquisition. Once that memory is acquired, however, these same dopamine neurons continue signaling. Except this time, the signal goes through the DAMB receptor, which triggers forgetting of those recently acquired, but not yet consolidated, memories.
<br>
<br>
Jacob Berry, a graduate student who led the experimentation, showed that inhibiting the dopamine
signaling after learning enhanced the flies' memory. Hyperactivating those same neurons after learning erased memory. And, a mutation in one of the receptors, dDA1, produced flies unable to learn, while a mutation in the other, DAMB, blocked forgetting.
We generally recall few things without our intention by our sub conscious memory
