        Hello everyone , your listening to the podcast , listen to the voice of unknown realities bringing you some facts and figures related to astonishing and thrilling topics
        This is the very first episode of our podcast.
        <br>
        And today it's all about the parallel universe and the Cosmos .
        <br>
Some of you might heard about the concept of existence of a parallel universe to that of ours . This particular episode is going to increase your curiosity and knowledge on this Concept , for those who haven't heard about it till now, u have an idea by the end of this podcast. Keep listening till the end.

Though the idea of parallel universe is used extensively from years in entertainment world cosmologists and astronomers are in search of evidence to unwrap these astonishing and bizarre secrets . Speaking of universe what exactly does universe comprise.. universe is the total amount of space and time which means everything that existed ,that exists and will exist in the future.the branch of astronomy that is concerned with origin ,evolution and enventual fate of the universe is called as cosmology.
<br>
<br>the first thing we are acquainted with when it comes to the universe is the Big Bang.The Big Bang theory is a cosmological model of the universe that describes the large scale evolution of universe from its initial state of very high density and temperature. The word Big bang might baffle you to misinterpret it as an explosion . But what it actually implies is an expansion . 
<br><br>Moving to the next chapter what really happened after the big bang. In 1980 Alan guth proposed a cosmic inflation theory which refers to rapid explosive expansion of spacetime that occurred for a tiny fraction of second after the big bang that's how the universe in which we exist has evolved.here pops a question. is universe stil expanding or it is static.around 1930 Edwin Hubble figured out that the light from the remote galaxies was redshifted when he was looking into the space .redshift means the electromagnetic radiation such as light undergoes increase in its wavelength which indicates that these remote galaxies are moving apart from us. This observation of Edwin clearly demonstrates that the universe is expanding .
<br><br>Space isn't just something that sits there and things happen in it . space is a dynamic thing said Andreas Albrecht who was one of the founder of inflation cosmology.now a new questions arises gravity is doing when this expansion is going on. As we all know Gravity is something that glues All the planets and all the galaxies together.but engrossing fact is that there is a character in this play
Which is now bought under the spotlight its called repulsive gravity .
<br><br>From Einstein's theory of relativity gravity can also push things away.This assists us to elucidate the rationale behind the expansion of the universe.repulsive gravity of dark energy out in the space is not only the reason behind the expansion but also supports a statement that the rate of expansion is ever quickening .
<br><br> Did you ever think if there is anything that is wider than an universe yes it is that's a multiverse
.multiverse is a hypothetical group of multiple universes in which we have different alternative or parallel universes .parallel universe is one of the most exciting assumptions ever made. if there is one then what would you be doing on that universe at this moment.maybe you have made different decisions that universe .parallel universe is an alternate universe or alternate reality. It's a hypothetical self-contained plane coexisting with one's own.
<br><br>
When we BackTrack things there is a point where time loses its meaning that's before the Big Bang .time was not directional and neither it had boundaries , it was free like a sphere without edges that could roll in any direction randomly said Stephen Hawking. Stephen and Thomas hertog were trying ' to prove the existence of parallel universes using these assumptions.maybe the concept od time becoming meaningless might seem senseless so let's have a glance at this example to grasp this .if there is a person who heads towards southpole after sometime when he eventually reaches thee then the word South pole would lose its meaning . this is what Stephen Hawking had tried to explain in his final paper before he died which is published in the journal of high energy physics .this paper predicts that there might be some parallel universes with the laws of physics like ours . but Stephen Hawking and Thomas hertog required evidence to prove this theoretical work .
<br><br>
Brian Greene is an American physicist , string theorist , and author of many books like the fabric of Cosmos which deals with the existence of multiple universes and the hidden reality of parallel universes and deep laws of Cosmos.
<br><br>
Now let's have a look at greens perspective towards the existence of parallel universe. Greene says that when we continuously shuffle a Deck of cards at a point ,the order of cards has to repeat itself. As we all are conscious that every thing that exists is constituted of matter . Even thought the matter arranges itself in infinite ways eventually sooner or later it has to repeat that way it arranges itself .that because there are only finite number of elements of matter , considering this there would be a probability of existence of a parallel universe like ours from those infinite number of universes if they actually exist .
<br><br>
Right now they may be many thoughts colliding in your brain. Let's add one more to them. as we know expansion is a generic property of universe. This property of the universe can seems to a hope for the existence of parallel or multiple universes.when these universes are expanding unceasingly with an increasing rate then there might be a chance of collision of them however for this to happen the rate of expansion should exceed the repulsive gravity force and when this collision actually takes place that would cause ripples in microwave background radiation which is still are not found .
<br><br>All these statements and explainations on existance of parallel universe are just shot in the dark .they still need a stamp of approval.and that approval is a tough but to be cracked
Even if this tough nut is cracked later in the future that will still have plenty questions to be answered like is there any probability that they would have same sort of life of us , what are the laws governing that universe .
<br><br>
How can we travel through space and reach there. Is there even any possibility that we can ever reach to this mirror universes
