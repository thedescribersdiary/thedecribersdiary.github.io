            Hello listeners

You are listening to the podcast the voice of unknown realities.
<br>
<br>
Here we are to share some amusing facts and figures in the most simplest ways so that you can listen and enjoy them .
Its our third episode and this episode is a bit dominated by the physics .
<br>
<br>
There are many diverse invisible things happening in that sky most of us love to stare . In Today's episode we are going to dive into the concept of lightning and thunders .
We all have read that the lightning is followed by thunders so let's follow the nature's order and start the episode with lightnings . This visible flash in the sky that captures your eyes is a method of nature to balance the electrical charges either within the cloud or the cloud and the ground .
<br>
<br>
To know how the charges are created you need to have knowledge upon the contents residing inside the clouds.
Clouds are an assemble of tiny water droplets , small ice crystals and some dust particles. the icecrystals are formed from water drops since the temperature over there is so cool .whenever these water droplets and ice crystals collide due their movements inside a thundercloud they create positive and negative charges which get concentrated at the top and the base of the thunder clouds respectively.negative charges being settled at the bottom will induce the positive charges upon the ground, this results in imbalance between the electric charges and this imbalance is corrected by the lightning.
<br>
<br>
Negative and positive charges attract each other and this attraction is so strong that the current made up of the electrons flows down towards the earth . This enormous flow of electricity appears as a flash that's the lightning . Lightning can be of two types . One that confined within the clouds which is the most commonest form .and the other one is between the clouds and the ground.the lightning that's within the clouds is because of the potential difference in the charge within those thunder clouds.
Speaking about a typical cloud and ground lightening. its a step wise proces of flowing of negative charges down to the earth . that's called a stepped leader .
<br>
<br>
Each step is about 150 feet long . And in the last step thats when the negative charges are only 150 feet away from the positively charged body which can be a tree building or a person , the positive charges tend to move towards the negative charges which is called streamer. Then these charges come in contact with each other and the negative charges flows down to transfer the electricity to the body
Let's have breif look at different patterns of cloud ground lightening .
<br>
<br>
Yes there are four variations among lightnings if you haven't observed them , do it the next time You experience lightnings and thunders .
Staccato lightning: it's a short duration stroke that appears as a single very bright flash with considerable branching .
Forked lightning:this type of lightning exhibits braching in its path down to the earth .
<br>
<br>

Ribbon lightning: it's a visual appearance of a lightning flashe's return strokes or multiple strokes being separated by a visible amount of gap between them because of high cross winds during thunder stroms .
Bead lightning: it's a rare form of cloud ground lightning that appears to break into a small bright sections like beads in a string and last for a longer duration than a normal lightening flash.
To induce more thoughts into your brain let's jump into the next section of our episode regarding the thunders .
Thunder is a loud sound caused by the lightning. lightning being very hot increases the temperature around it by about 5 times more than the sun's surface . As we all know that heating is going to expand things. This sudden Increase in the temperature and the pressure is going to expand the air which results in formation of a sonic shock wave that's similar to the one formed in explosion .this is the reason exactly what why you get to hear thunderstorm.
<br>
<br>
Here are some absorbing facts about thunders .
<br>
<br>
during every minute there are thousands of thunderstorms around the earth causing about nearly 6,000 flashes of lightnings each minute.
To know how close the lightening is you need to count the time gap in seconds between the lightning and thunder . each second accounts for about 300 m . The Lesser the time gap between them the closer the lightening is .thunders are not only heard during thunderstorms and rains but also can be heard during the snow which is quite rare.
There are ways through which we humans can simulate these lightenings that's artificial lightning.
Artificial lightening is generated in the same way as the static energy by rubbing or collision of charged particles like dust particles or water droplets in the air.
<br>
<br>
this way of producing lightening won't be efficient since the energy used to throw the particles up into the air and make them move and collide with each other would be much more than the electrical power actually produced as an output of the lightning.
artificial lightening is created in places like National electrical energy testing research and appliances centre where it is used to generate power that will help us to overcome some energy
crisis and also to test the ability of the new appliances and machines to survive the lightning strikes.
<br>
<br>
Coming to the feasible method to generate an lightening or artificial is using capacitor banks capacitor unlike battery can store use amount of electrical energy in it and then we can dump this multi-million volts electricity which is passed from the capacitor to another electrode or any other body in near to it . a million volts electricity can jump about 5 to 6 feet in the open air but we can place some wires in between them so that the electricity can follow the path of these wires , which requires less voltage compared to the one consumed in the open air .
<br>
<br>
Equipment that are mandatory for generating and artificial lightning are high discharge capacitor , switches and some safety components together all are called energy discharge unit whenever we discharge multimillion volts of energy that's going to pass through the wire and vaporize it which leads to production if an electrical Arc along wire that resembles the lightening .naturally some types of lightening are forked in order to produce lightnings with branchs we need to place a series of wires in segments which can be vaporized or exploded one after the other to give us an appearance of forked lightening and also we can use different types of wires to produce coloured arcs ike a red , yellow and many more .
<br>
<br>
Let's end this episode with a quote . Raise your words not voice
It's the rain that grows flowers not thunders .
