        Hello listeners,Welcome to our 6 th episode and you are listening to the podcast,The describers diary.
        <br>
        <br>
        I wish everyone are safe out there  today we are on a ride to explore about cannibalism in the animal kingdom which is one of the undigestable concepts to believe.
        And this ride might cover most of places since the unexpected fact  here is that it is widespread .
        <br>
        <br>
        Cannibalism is an act where animals including humans consume and digest other individuals of same species as food .
        <br>
        <br>
        Here is a  spicy example of cannibalism
        <br>
        <br>
        It's like an hen making omlet with its own eggs or eating chicken Biryani of other hen .if it enjoys that type of cuisine.
        <br>
        <br>
        Cannibalism also known as anthropophagy is a common ecological interaction in the animal kingdom it's noticable in more than 1,500 spices .and more commonly  in the aquatic life.this act of cannibalism differs from species to species.
        <br>
        <br>
        In some spiders like red back spider,black widow spider and some scorpion's  . female consumes on male organism after mating. the male sacrifices itself for its offsprings. half way through the mating process while  the male continues to transfer sperms. the female spider will start feeding on it. Although females often instigate cannibalism it can happen the other way round like in micaria socibialis a type spiders where old female spiders with low reproductive potential are consumed by males when the food resources are limited.
        <br>
        <br>
        Next comes the filial cannibalism :
filial cannibalism is a specific type of sized structured cannibalism in which adults eat their own offsprings.
It includes parental consumption of still born infants where the babies are born lifeless and miscarried foetus as well as infertile eggs.
<br>
<br>
The increase rate of cannibalism due to global warming in polar bears is now a focus point since it might lead to extinction of species sooner on latter , polar bears being hypercarnivorous animals feed on their fellow bears and even on there offsprings due to food shortage.
<br>
<br>
It can also happen vice versa where young cannibal kids dine on  there mother .there is a special case in caecilians , caecilians come under aamphiansthe group to which frogs belong to but they don't have any limbs like frogs . these caecilians mother's feed there young one with there flesh . Young caecilians shave special type of teeth through which they peel off layers of there mother's skin and feed on it .
<br>
<br>
Fighting with your siblings is common but in some species like sand tiger shark and fire  salamanders siblings feed on each other in inside mother's uterus and that's called Intrauterine cannibalism though multiple embryos are formed but only one or two babies are born.The larger and stronger embroyos consume their less developed siblings as a source of nutriention.
<br>
<br>

Even though concept  of cannibalism sounds uncanny There are few specific ecological reasons for it take place.To maintain the  population of species which is very essential for ecological balance.And also in some species like tiger salamnders it can be for extra nutrition to increase there chances of survival of larva , some of cannibal larve feasts on it's non canniabal larve risiding together  in order to sustain the competition for survival in huge population of larve for the species to continue there existence on this earth.
<br>
<br>
Moving into our next section .
Most uncanny among them is human cannibalism Not just in ancient times but even today there are many human cannibals feeding on human flesh.
<br>
<br>
The history of cannibalism started at time when  Neanderthals The extinct species of humans and modern humans coexisted. They interbred. They ate together, and even ate each other sometimes.
During periods of starvation, Neanderthals supplemented their diets with cannibalism, study on eight 43,000-year-old Neanderthal skeletons in 2006.
Provided evidence of cannibalism since there bones possesed cuts and few  indications that these individuals were butchered.
<br>
<br>

Not just for nutritional purposes but The earliest humans in Europe 32,000 years ago practiced ritual cannibalism  as a part of funeral rites .In some cases, the body of a dead person was ritually eaten by his relatives, that's a form called endocannibalism.
<br>
<br>
In India u can come across cannibalism in aghoras
They are Indian ascetics  who believe that eating human flesh confers spiritual and physical benefits, such as prevention of aging.
<br>
<br>

canabolism is of 2 types in humans are
1.endocanabolism
2.exocanabolism
<br>
<br>
Endocanabolism ; In some societies, especially tribal societies, cannibalism is a cultural norm as we mentioned earlier cannibalism of the recently deceased can be a  part of the grieving process or be seen as a way of guiding the souls of the dead into the bodies of living descendants.
Exocannibalism is the consumption of a person from outside the community, usually as a celebration of victory against a rival tribe.
<br>
<br>

But even in this civilized era  canabolism is continued due to  myths and believes And also the major reason for canabolism is competition for food when there is a food shortage. Many instances of cannibalism were recorded during World War II  where food supply to soldiers is not sufficient .
<br>
<br>
There are some DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN CANABOLISM  which spread to people because of consumption of human flesh like kuru and madcow disease
