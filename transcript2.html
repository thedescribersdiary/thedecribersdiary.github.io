            Favipiravir -- the covid drug
            Hello listeners , you are listening to the podcast , listen to the voice of unknown realities
            Bringing you some thrilling and undiscussed aspects about the current pandemic causing virus and the drug just got approved to over come it.
            Before any drug is released into the market to t . it has to undergo phases of trials and get approved. There are five clinal phases for drug testing. From phase 0 to phase 4 .
<br>
<br>            
            Favipiravir has undergone and been successfull in crossing the all the phases of clinical trials from 0 to 3 approved by the DCIG drug control general of India under the brand name fabiflu that is produced by the Glenmark Pharma. Now it's going to be released in the market and undergo the phase 4.phase 4 of trials include the post marketing surveillance which involves the pharmacovigilance of the drug after being sold. pharmacovigilance is a science that deals with assessment and prevention of any adverse effects related to drugs by collecting the information from a large scale population since the clinical trials are done only on a limited number of patients.

            Let's know more about the drug favipiravir
            It's and oral antiviral drug that's mostly indicated to treat novel or Re-emerging influenza viral infection in which other anti-influenza viral agents are not effective.
            Trade names of favipiravir are avigan and avifavir .
            <br>
            <br>
            Being a Broad spectrum antibiotic drug it can be used to treat so many other viruses .it's a prodrug. prodrug is an inactive form of a drug which gets activated after it enters into the body. Favipiravir undergoes phosphorylation reaction and gets converted into its active metabolite .
            To know how this drug actually works inside our body reaching each cell you need to have an idea about the structure of coronavirus
            <br>
            <br>
            Speaking of it the genetic material of covid 19 virus is positive sense RNA. genetic material is something that carries your genes like DNA in humans. which is protected by an envelope or coat and this envelope has got number of surface projections called spikes . spikes are homotrimers of proteins called s protein.every cellin our body has cytoplasm surrounded by cell membrane and have a cell organelles like ribosomes mitochondria and nucleus in cytoplasm. Once the virus enters into your body it uses its spikes to fuse with the cell membrane. And then the enzyme protease from the host cell degrades the spike proteins and allows the virus to enter into the host cell cytoplasm. After entering the virus removes its envelope and releases its genetic material into the host cell cytoplasm .Now let's know how the drug favipiravir actually works against the corona virus.
            <br>
            <br>
            Whenever a bacteria or a virus enters into the body the prime motive of it is to increase its number by replication which causes signs nd symptoms.
            This drug works by inhibiting this replication of virus
            RNA is of Different types .one among them is mRNA . Let's have a detailed explanation on this. Once the rna of virus is released free into the cytoplasm ,the ribosome of host cell is going to read out all the information in the genes being carried by this mRNa and synthesizes proteins according to that information this is called translation . Translation is a part in the process of expressing the information inside the genes.
            <br>
            <br>
            And these proteins undergo degradation into numerous small non-structural proteins , some of them combined together to form multi protein replication complexes one of which is RNA polymerase that is very essential for the replication of the rna and formation of new viral particles.favipiravir inhibits the action of RNA polymerase which is the enzyme that is responsible for polymerization of new rna from existing ones .
            Favipiravir when incorporated stops this polymerization process of RNA in the middle leading to produce damged rna hence it stops the virus from increasing its population and casmusing diasease .but It may not kill the existing ones.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thats how this drug works inside the drug.
            Let's hope that it's helps us to save lives and control this pandemic
